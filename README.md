## Lessons Learned

All in all, this project progressed relatively quickly. One key takeaway was the importance of staying organized, especially as this was one of my first collaborative projects on GitHub. Leveraging GitHubâ€™s issue tracking, pull requests, and other collaboration tools was critical in ensuring a smooth workflow between myself and the other developer, helping us avoid common pitfalls like branch synchronization errors.
